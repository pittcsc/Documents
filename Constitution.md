# CSC Constitution

## I) Name of Organization

The Computer Science Club at the University of Pittsburgh, also referred to as:

- Computer Science Club at Pitt
- CS Club at Pitt
- CSC at Pitt
- CSC

## II) Acceptance and Compliance to Certification Requirements and Limitations

CSC and its membership accept and will fully comply with the requirements and limits of certification.

## III) Limits of Certification

The organization and its members accept and will comply with the following limits of certification: Certified student organizations are student associations and are not official components of the University of Pittsburgh (hereinafter "the University" or "Pitt"). Certification does not permit a student organization to use or act in the name of the University, to represent the University, engage in any contractual obligation in the name of the University nor represent the organization as being an official part of the University. While certified student organizations are permitted to have external affiliations, may be part of an incorporated external organization or may be individually incorporated. Certification expressly permits certified student organizations to only operate on campus. Off-campus activities of certified student organizations are the sole responsibility of the organization, officers, and members, unless expressly approved in advance by the University. Membership in a certified student organization and participation in its activities are voluntary, and all risks of personal injury, property damage, or other losses incidental to membership or participation in such activities are assumed solely by the student organization and/or individual member(s) or participant(s).

## IV) Annual Recertification

The organization will submit its re-registration application once a year during the defined re-registration process.

## V) Purpose

CSC exists as tool to build a community of students interested in computer science (CS), regardless of declared major. It is intended to be a community of members to develop professionally, engage with each other socially, and explore the field of CS intellectually.

## VI) Pillars

The purpose of CSC is threefold, and outlined as such:

### Community
CSC is devoted to enriching the communities which it is and is a member: The community of undergraduates interested in CS, the community that is the University, and the Greater Pittsburgh area. Events, programs, outreach, initiatives, and interactions with stakeholders in said communities to provide benefit to such communities is thus a principal pillar to CSC's purpose.

### Education
CSC hopes to provide a means for students to gain skills that they wouldn't learn in class through student, professor, and industry leader presentations on new and exciting advancements in CS. CSC will aspire towards greater initiatives to innovate the education of its members such as implementing mentorship programs and new and exciting projects. CSC, in addition to educating current members, will work to preserve knowledge for future members through recording of presentations, maintaining documents on projects, etc.

### Professional Development
CSC aspires to act as a guide and mentor for its members as they develop necessary skills and connections to get the most value from their education. Through initiatives and programs such as resume reviews, programming experience in CSC group projects, interview prep, networking opportunities, and programming competitions, CSC will create skilled members ready to succeed in their endeavors after graduation.

These factors include race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sex, age, marital status, familial status, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, genetic information, disability, or status as a veteran.  All groups, except those exempt by law, must permit male and female membership.  Sport clubs involving physical contact or in which participation is based on competitive skill may limit participation in competition to one sex; provided that, for any for any such sport club engaged in a non-contact sport, unless there is a sport club available for members of the opposite sex, the club must permit try-outs for each sex.

## XV) Voting Powers of Officers

Officers retain voting rights on all major decisions of the organization.

## XV) Executive Board Powers

Each officer of CSC also retains membership on the CSC Executive Board. Each member of the board must act as a representative of CSC and ensure its fair governance. Members of the board each have a vote on major issues and initiatives of CSC, and are responsible for assisting other officers in the fulfillment of their individual roles.

A Supervisor is an officer position created by the Executive Board at the request of the Director of Initiatives. Supervisors cannot be members of the Executive Board, and are created and dissolved through a simple majority vote of the Executive Board. They may perform annual, ad hoc functions (e.g., SteelHacks Director, Recruitment Lead, or managers for club projects) or they may be created to assist or lead tasks not explicitly assigned to a constitutionally defined officer and which need consistent management (e.g., Social Media Manager, SCI Ambassador, or Alumni Outreach Director). These Supervisors are to be primarily managed and assisted by the Vice President and Director of Initiatives, though other officers may help or work with them when deemed expedient. Supervisor positions are named "X Initiative Lead" where X refers to the project under supervision.


## XVI) Removal of Officers

If the board decides that a particular officer is not fulfilling their duties as set out above and/or decided upon otherwise, the board can move to replace that officer by a two-thirds majority vote.

If 40 active club members submit a petition supporting the removal of an officer, the board must vote on the removal of the officer within five business days of submission by a simple majority vote. Petitions are to be submitted to the Vice President. The Vice President must call the vote, and publish the results of the vote within 24 hours of when all votes are submitted. If the Vice President fails to fulfill these duties, they shall be removed by default.

If an executive board member fails to vote or there is a vacancy, their vote will default in favor of removal. As a penalty for failing to vote, for the rest of the absent officer's term, they may be removed at any time by a simple majority vote.

Votes may be made asynchronously. If an officer votes to remove themselves, it is treated as a resignation and no further voting is required.

If there are more than two vacancies within the officer board, there must be no more than one dissenting vote to remove an additional officer. For example, a six-member board would need a two-thirds majority vote to remove an officer, a five-member board would need a four-member majority, and a four-member board would need a three-member majority.

The board must have at least three officers; therefore, no officers may be removed if the board only consists of three members.

## XVII) Vacancies

Vacancies will be filled by appointment from the board. The replacement will hold the position until elections for the subsequent term take place. Each position **must** be filled, though a current officer is not permitted to hold multiple positions.

At the discretion of the board, a special election can be called to fill a vacancy. The procedures of a special election are to be determined by the board to ensure a swift filling of the vacancy while maintaining a fair election.

If the position of Director of Initiatives is vacant, the new Director must be elected from the existing Supervisors. All executive board members and Supervisors may vote in this election. The winner is chosen via simple majority. Re-votes will be held to eliminate candidates until a winner is chosen unless no consensus can be reached. If no consensus can be reached or a new Director cannot be elected from existing Supervisors for whatever reason, the vacancy shall be filled by special election.

## XIX) Meetings

Meetings will normally be held twice a week at usual dates and times in order to provide time for CSC activities. Special meetings can be called by the President or Vice President. The President or their designee will take on the responsibilities of the Chairperson, and will be responsible for running group meetings, including but not limited to introducing and interviewing guests, initiating group work and networking time, giving information about upcoming opportunities for CS students, and discussing current events in the technological community.


## XX) Finances

Group funds will be spent to provide enhancement to CSC activities, including but not limited to helping to offset the costs of attending hackathons, providing refreshments during events, and paying for software subscriptions.  All expenses must be approved by the Business Manager and President. The organization will not maintain an outside bank account if it receives funding from the University of Pittsburgh Student Government Board (SGB).

CSC shall fully comply with the University's fundraising policies and procedures for certified student organizations.

## XXI) Publications Code

In compliance with the Publications Code for Student Organizations, all publications of the organization will comply with current copywriter laws, be distributed according to policies and procedures, refrain from expressions that are considered obscene or libelous according to current statute, advocate or insight the material interference or physical disruption of the educational process of the peace, order and decorum of the campus, or that advocate or insight imminent, lawless action or the violent overthrow of the government and identify the organization as publisher and specify that the group is a registered student organization at the University of Pittsburgh. 

## XXII) Advisor

The group advisor shall be selected by the board by a simple majority vote. In the event that an advisor must be removed, a simple majority must approve the decision.
The advisor is not required to provide any particular services to CSC, but is encouraged to take an interest in the education of the group's members and is welcome to participate in any of the group's activities, especially in their area of technical expertise.

Additionally, all former officers of CSC, so long as they remain Pitt students, will serve as an advisory body. This old guard of CSC will be expected to provide advice to the board when solicited. Otherwise, they may take as much interest in the affairs of CSC as any other associate member.

## XXIII) External Affiliations

CSC has two forms of external affiliation: Sponsors and Community Partners.

### Sponsor
CSC Sponsors support CSC and its activities financially. Sponsors may be invited to events and programs, networking opportunities, limited access to CSC data, and advertisement and exposure within CSC.

### Community Partner
CSC Community Partners are reciprocal relationships with organizations based in the Greater Pittsburgh Area. CSC recognizes Community Partners for continued aid in organizing co-hosted programs, encouraging interactions between organization members, and developing a strong community within CSC, the University, and the City of Pittsburgh.

## XXIV) By-Laws

CSC officers must be present at the majority of CSC meetings or otherwise significantly contribute to the majority of CSC meetings.

The President, Vice President, and Business Manager may choose to swap their roles at any time. Such changes must be reported to SORC.

In order for the officers to understand the state and effectiveness of CSC and it's members, CSC does collect certain pieces of information. All officers should be aware of what data are collected and should strive to keep the collection to a minimum and keep the data private and protected in order to uphold the privacy of CSC members.

### What is collected
Data collection is limited to meeting attendance; activity in the CSC Discord server; activity on CSC's GitHub organization, including GitHub commits and their impacts; surveys; check-in and sign-up sheets; CSC newsletters; digital communications; images and video for CSC's social media platforms; and events, including collaborations with other organizations. Data collection also includes auxiliary information gained via systems used to administer our programs, including but not limited to: survey systems, bots, and website telemetry tools.

### What is the data used for
The information is used to evaluate how effective a particular event is, how attendance changes over the course of a semester, etc. The activity of CSC members helps the officers determine whether an individual is a member of CSC based on the definition in Section VII, to whom to provide incentives for being a member, and in special cases giving a higher priority to a member who has higher engagement with CSC to attend limited-seated events. In addition, we use it to encourage sponsors to sponsor CSC through giving accurate general statistics about the organization.

### What data is given out
No data on a individual member, except for any information that a member has consented for the officers to give out, will be given to any organization outside of CSC unless CSC is in active collaboration with that organization or conduct procedures necessitates. CSC only provides outside organizations with general statistics of CSC (e.g., average attendance and demographics of members).

### How transparent is CSC
The Executive Board and CSC will be transparent as to what is collected and the purpose behind collecting data. CSC will gladly reveal all general statistics that it provides to outside organizations. CSC will not reveal an individual member's data except to the individual directly. Non-commercial tools used to analyze and collect data will be made public with all of its source code available on CSC's GitHub organization page.

### Issues
Any issues with CSC policy on data should be brought up with any officers. Any member is free to appeal to the Executive Board to opt out of certain data collection. Any future additions to what is collected should be discussed by the officers internally and with all the active members.

## XXV) Amendments

Amendments to this Constitution may be submitted by any active club member. For approval, an amendment must receive a two-thirds majority vote of approval from the board. Amendments must be voted on at the next upcoming meeting from when they are submitted, but their implementation, if successful, may be deferred to the next semester or academic year. Amendments cannot be passed when there is a vacancy unless inability to pass the amendment would cause a disruption in the registration status of the organization

All constitution additions, revisions, and deletions must be reported to SORC. Constitutional changes are not official until approved by SORC.

# CSC Code of Conduct

version: v1.3
-------------
This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the **Computer Science Club at Pitt** community as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may face sanctions, including banishment from the community.

Our open-source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, socioeconomic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a worldwide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful**:  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.
* **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that weâ€™re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesnâ€™t mean that theyâ€™re wrong. Donâ€™t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesnâ€™t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Definitions

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotypicality/neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political affiliation, or religious belief
- Unwelcome comments regarding a personâ€™s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment
- Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming (referring to a transgender individual by a name they used prior to transitioning) or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person's gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions like "\*hug\*" or "\*backrub\*") without consent or after a request to stop
- Threats of violence, both physical and psychological
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or engage in self-harm
- Deliberate intimidation
- Stalking or following
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
- Sustained disruption of discussion
- Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse
- Publication of non-harassing private communication

Our community prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

- 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism', 'reverse sexism', and 'cisphobia'
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone", "go away", or "I'm not discussing this with you"
- Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cisgenderist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Advertisements

Advertisements are **not** to be posted in the CSC Discord server without prior officer approval. Advertisements may be deleted at the discretion of the CSC officers.

### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political belief, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviorâ€”or have any other concernsâ€”please report it by contacting us via **pittcsc@gmail.com**. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g., a mailing list archive, public IRC logger, email conversation, or private/direct messages on social media), please include a link.
- Any additional information that may be helpful

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.

# CSC Property Code

version: v1.0
-------------

This code outlines the expectations for club members regarding club property. Our organization, while not a legal entity, holds property through University accounts and custodial ownership by members. This code provides a framework for dealing with property within the context of CSC membership. Members may face sanctions, including banishment from our community, for violations of the property code.

## Definitions of Property

Property can be either physical or non-physical, monetary or non-monetary. 

Club property can include items being leased to the club, to a member of the club, or items being leased between members of the club, within the context of CSC activities/initiatives. Leased club property can include property owned by someone internal or external to CSC. In either case, all ownership and control remains with the persons in that agreement - not CSC - however CSC can sanction members for violations involving the property of these agreements since it is in the interests of our club to set expectations regarding the stewardship of peoples' property when they make it available to members for a CSC related activity/initiative. Leased club property may or may not include an actual verbal/written contract, just the understanding that the lessee is being given access to the property within the context of CSC activities/initiative.

> Contracts between CSC officers and vendors must include the following statement as per SORC guidelines: "The parties hereto agree and understand that the University of Pittsburgh is not a party to this contract and that the University of Pittsburgh is not responsible, under any circumstances for performing any obligations of this contract."

Examples of physical property include, but are not limited to:
- Merchandise
- Recruitment materials such as:
    - Tables
    - Table cloths

    - CPUs
    - GPUs
    - Memory sticks
    - Server racks
    - Cables
    - TVs/Monitors
    - etc.
- Physical cash (in accordance with SORC rules)
- Venues

Items become club property by:
1. The owner(s) declaring an item as club property, AND
2. The CSC officers accepting the club property on behalf of the club

Items unbecome club property by:
1. Reclamation by owner(s) via terms outlined in property declaration, OR
2. Release by officer team via gift, sale, or trade

Unless explicitly agreed upon, all declarations are assumed to contain no stipulations regarding use, distribution, and reclamation.

Not all club property is eligible for distribution.

Restrictions can be put in place by the officer team to restrict access to club property, including but not limited to:
- Being a member of the officer team
- Participation in a specific CSC initiative
- Ability of member to properly store and/or use property (for its intended use) in accordance with all agreements the member is a party of (including the Pitt Residential Handbook)

- first-come-first-serve basis
- having higher meeting attendance
- having higher participation/score in another relevant quantifiable activity
- fair competition
- random selection
- stipulations in the property declaration that allow the original owner/lessor to select the recipient

## Collection of Club Property
