- CSC

## II) Acceptance and Compliance to Certification Requirements and Limitations

CSC and its membership accept and will fully comply with the requirements and limits of certification.

## III) Limits of Certification

The organization and its members accept and will comply with the following limits of certification: Certified student organizations are student associations and are not official components of the University of Pittsburgh (hereinafter "the University" or "Pitt"). Certification does not permit a student organization to use or act in the name of the University, to represent the University, engage in any contractual obligation in the name of the University nor represent the organization as being an official part of the University. While certified student organizations are permitted to have external affiliations, may be part of an incorporated external organization or may be individually incorporated. Certification expressly permits certified student organizations to only operate on campus. Off-campus activities of certified student organizations are the sole responsibility of the organization, officers, and members, unless expressly approved in advance by the University. Membership in a certified student organization and participation in its activities are voluntary, and all risks of personal injury, property damage, or other losses incidental to membership or participation in such activities are assumed solely by the student organization and/or individual member(s) or participant(s).

## IV) Annual Recertification

The organization will submit its re-registration application once a year during the defined re-registration process.

## V) Purpose

CSC exists as tool to build a community of students interested in computer science (CS), regardless of declared major. It is intended to be a community of members to develop professionally, engage with each other socially, and explore the field of CS intellectually.

## VI) Pillars

The purpose of CSC is threefold, and outlined as such:

### Community
CSC is devoted to enriching the communities which it is and is a member: The community of undergraduates interested in CS, the community that is the University, and the Greater Pittsburgh area. Events, programs, outreach, initiatives, and interactions with stakeholders in said communities to provide benefit to such communities is thus a principal pillar to CSC's purpose.

### Education
CSC hopes to provide a means for students to gain skills that they wouldn't learn in class through student, professor, and industry leader presentations on new and exciting advancements in CS. CSC will aspire towards greater initiatives to innovate the education of its members such as implementing mentorship programs and new and exciting projects. CSC, in addition to educating current members, will work to preserve knowledge for future members through recording of presentations, maintaining documents on projects, etc.

### Professional Development
CSC aspires to act as a guide and mentor for its members as they develop necessary skills and connections to get the most value from their education. Through initiatives and programs such as resume reviews, programming experience in CSC group projects, interview prep, networking opportunities, and programming competitions, CSC will create skilled members ready to succeed in their endeavors after graduation.

### President
The President is the chief representative and leader of CSC. The President will attend and manage all CSC functions when possible. They are responsible for creating and maintaining an open and welcoming community by working with the other officers to assist in completion of their tasks. They are responsible for keeping all officers on task and ensuring successful management of CSC.

### Vice President
The Vice President handles all communication and interactions with persons and organizations outside the University. This includes reviewing and reading external communication via email and other queries, maintaining contact with local groups and organizations relevant to CSC, and assisting in sponsorship or community partner communications. The Vice President also fulfills the role and/or responsibilities of President when the President is not present or at the President's request.

### Business Manager
The Business Manager is responsible for CSC finances and maintenance of CSC records. They will also be the main point of contact for the University of Pittsburgh Student Organization Resource Center (hereinafter "SORC"). They will handle finances, distribute reimbursements, attend mandatory SORC training events, and maintain organized attendance records and other documents or data for CSC.

### Director of Initiatives
The Director of Initiatives will brainstorm and create new programs, activities, and methodology (initiatives) for CSC. They will manage any and all Supervisor positions, and is empowered to create new Supervisors with Executive Board approval.

### Events Coordinator
The Events Coordinator is responsible for planning activities run by CSC. They will set dates and manage a semesterly timeline and calendar and for each event will confirm location, food, speakers, promotional material, etc. In accomplishing this task, they must coordinate with other officers.

### Special Events Organizer
The Special Events Organizer is in charge of planning special events—especially events in collaboration with other organizations. This means student organizations such as Women in Computer Science (WiCS), Kappa Theta Pi (KTP), and the Robotics and Automation Society (RAS); the School of Computing and Information (SCI); and communication with any other body within the University. This includes coordinating interesting speakers and incentives for hackathon events.

### Public Relations and Communications Manager
The Public Relations and Communications Manager is responsible for all communication and interactions with persons or organizations within the University. This includes student organizations, SCI, and alumni of CSC. The Public Relations and Communications Manager is also responsible for CSC's public presence and brand. They will run all social media platforms, send email newsletters, and create promotional material and external advertisements.

## XIV) Election of Officers

Elections will be held in each Spring semester to determine the officers for the following Fall and Spring semesters.

Only freshmen and sophomores are permitted to run for Event Coordinator. Should no freshmen or sophomores declare the intent to run for any of these positions by the deadline to declare intent to run, then any member will be permitted to run.

The President will preside over elections, announcing them to the general body at least one month prior to the election date via any and all available means of communication with the general body. Any candidate must inform the President of their intent to run at least one week before the scheduled date of the election. Prior to the election day, the President will confirm that all candidates are CSC members according to the requirements set out in this Constitution. Following confirmation, all valid candidates will be announced by the President to the general body before the election date.

On the day of the election, a general body meeting will be held. There, the President will address the general body and commence elections. Each office will be elected before the next in the following order: President, Vice President, Business Manager, Event Coordinator. For each office, all candidates will be given at most five minutes to speak to the general body, followed by another five minutes for the members to ask questions. After all candidates have gone through this process for an office, voting shall proceed for that office.

Votes shall be recorded by secret ballot, and votes shall be counted by the President and the Vice President independently. No others will be permitted to view individual votes. Once the votes have been tallied by the President and Vice President, they will check if they have independently counted the same number of votes for each candidate. If a discrepancy occurs, they will count again and check with each other until they conclude the same totals or decide on a motion to re-vote on account of suspicion of fraud. Once the votes are validated in this fashion, the candidate with the majority of votes is declared the winner. Should no candidate reach a majority of total votes, the candidate with the least votes is removed from consideration, and a re-vote with the remaining candidates shall be held immediately.
If fraud in voting is suspected by any member, they can make a motion to re-vote with a brief explanation for their suspicion. If the Vice President and President concur, a public re-vote shall be held for the suspected office(s).

## XV) Executive Board Powers

Each officer of CSC also retains membership on the CSC Executive Board. Each member of the board must act as a representative of CSC and ensure its fair governance. Members of the board each have a vote on major issues and initiatives of CSC, and are responsible for assisting other officers in the fulfillment of their individual roles.

## XVI) Supervisors, Initiative Leads

A Supervisor is an officer position created by the Executive Board at the request of the Director of Initiatives. Supervisors cannot be members of the Executive Board, and are created and dissolved through a simple majority vote of the Executive Board. They may perform annual, ad hoc functions (e.g., SteelHacks Director, Recruitment Lead, or managers for club projects) or they may be created to assist or lead tasks not explicitly assigned to a constitutionally defined officer and which need consistent management (e.g., Social Media Manager, SCI Ambassador, or Alumni Outreach Director). These Supervisors are to be primarily managed and assisted by the Vice President and Director of Initiatives, though other officers may help or work with them when deemed expedient. Supervisor positions are named "X Initiative Lead" where X refers to the project under supervision.

## XVII) Removal of Officers

If the board decides that a particular officer is not fulfilling their duties as set out above and/or decided upon otherwise, the board can move to replace that officer by a two-thirds majority vote.

If 40 active club members submit a petition supporting the removal of an officer, the board must vote on the removal of the officer within five business days of submission by a simple majority vote. Petitions are to be submitted to the Vice President. The Vice President must call the vote, and publish the results of the vote within 24 hours of when all votes are submitted. If the Vice President fails to fulfill these duties, they shall be removed by default.

If an executive board member fails to vote or there is a vacancy, their vote will default in favor of removal. As a penalty for failing to vote, for the rest of the absent officer's term, they may be removed at any time by a simple majority vote.

Votes may be made asynchronously. If an officer votes to remove themselves, it is treated as a resignation and no further voting is required.

If there are more than two vacancies within the officer board, there must be no more than one dissenting vote to remove an additional officer. For example, a six-member board would need a two-thirds majority vote to remove an officer, a five-member board would need a four-member majority, and a four-member board would need a three-member majority.

The board must have at least three officers; therefore, no officers may be removed if the board only consists of three members.

## XVIII) Vacancies

Vacancies will be filled by appointment from the board. The replacement will hold the position until elections for the subsequent term take place. Each position **must** be filled, though a current officer is not permitted to hold multiple positions.

At the discretion of the board, a special election can be called to fill a vacancy. The procedures of a special election are to be determined by the board to ensure a swift filling of the vacancy while maintaining a fair election.

If the position of Director of Initiatives is vacant, the new Director must be elected from the existing Supervisors. All executive board members and Supervisors may vote in this election, which otherwise follows election procedures as defined in Section XIV. If a new Director cannot be elected from existing Supervisors, the vacancy shall be filled by special election.

## XIX) Meetings

Meetings will be held once a week in order to provide time for networking and group project work. Additionally, there will be presentations given every two weeks about topics that are relevant to the education to the members of the group. Special meetings can be called by the President or Vice President, given that the general body is given at least five days' notice of the change. The President will take on the responsibilities of the Chairperson, and will be responsible for running group meetings, including but not limited to introducing and interviewing guests, initiating group work and networking time, giving information about upcoming opportunities for CS students, and discussing current events in the technological community.

## XX) Data

In order for the officers to understand the state and effectiveness of CSC and it's members, CSC does collect certain pieces of information. All officers should be aware of what data are collected and should strive to keep the collection to a minimum and keep the data private and protected in order to uphold the privacy of CSC members.

### What is collected
Data collection is limited to meeting attendance; activity in the CSC Discord server; activity on CSC's GitHub organization, including GitHub commits and their impacts; details about a member from setting up with and using a CSC attendance system; surveys; check-in and sign-up sheets; CSC newsletters; digital communications; images and video for CSC's social media platforms; and events.

### What is the data used for
The information is used to evaluate how effective a particular event is, how attendance changes over the course of a semester, etc. The activity of CSC members helps the officers determine whether an individual is a member of CSC based on the definition in Section VII, to whom to provide incentives for being a member, and in special cases giving a higher priority to a member who has higher engagement with CSC to attend limited-seated events. In addition, we use it to encourage sponsors to sponsor CSC through giving accurate general statistics about the organization.

### What data is given out
No data on a individual member, except for any information that a member has consented for the officers to give out, will be given to any organization outside of CSC. CSC only provides outside organizations with general statistics of CSC (e.g., average attendance and demographics of members).

### How transparent is CSC
The Executive Board and CSC will be transparent as to what is collected and the purpose behind collecting data. CSC will gladly reveal all general statistics that it provides to outside organizations. CSC will not reveal an individual member's data except to the individual directly. Non-commercial tools used to analyze and collect data will be made public with all of its source code available on CSC's GitHub organization page.

### Issues
Any issues with CSC policy on data should be brought up with any officers. Any member is free to appeal to the Executive Board to opt out of certain data collection. Any future additions to what is collected should be discussed by the officers internally and with all the active members.

## XXI) Finances

Group funds will be spent to provide enhancement to CSC activities, including but not limited to helping to offset the costs of attending hackathons, providing refreshments during events, and paying for software subscriptions.  All expenses must be approved by the Business Manager and President. The organization will not maintain an outside bank account if it receives funding from the University of Pittsburgh Student Government Board (SGB).

CSC shall fully comply with the University's fundraising policies and procedures for certified student organizations.

## XXII) Publications Code

In compliance with the Publications Code for Student Organizations, all the publications of the organization will comply with current copywriter laws, be distributed according to policies and procedures, refrain for expressions that are considered obscene or libelous according to current statute, advocate or insight the material interference or physical disruption of the educational process or the peace, order and decorum of the campus, or that advocate or insight imminent, lawless action or the violent overthrow of the government and identify the organization as publisher and specify that the group is a certified student organization at the University.

## XXIII) Club File Access

### Google Drive Folder

Upon changing officer roles, the outgoing president should grant the new president ownership rights to the CSC Google Drive folder. Incoming officers should report their google accounts to the incoming president, who will then grant them access permissions to the google drive. Outgoing officers' access will be revoked.

Current officers are the only individuals permitted access to the CSC Google Drive folder. Conditional access to individual documents or sub-folders may be administered at officer discretion.

### GitHub Organization

Upon changing officer roles, the outgoing president should grant the new president ownership rights to the CSC GitHub organization. Incoming officers should report their GitHub accounts to the incoming president, who will then grant them ownership permissions to the GitHub organization. Outgoing officers' access permissions should be downgraded from "owner" to "member".

Current officers are the only individuals permitted ownership access to the CSC GitHub organization. No conditional exemptions can be made to this rule.

## XXIV) Advisor

The group advisor shall be selected by the board by a simple majority vote. In the event that an advisor must be removed, a simple majority must approve the decision.
The advisor is not required to provide any particular services to CSC, but is encouraged to take an interest in the education of the group's members and is welcome to participate in any of the group's activities, especially in their area of technical expertise.

Additionally, all former officers of CSC, so long as they remain Pitt students, will serve as an advisory body. This old guard of CSC will be expected to provide advice to the board when solicited. Otherwise, they may take as much interest in the affairs of CSC as any other associate member.

## XXV) External Affiliations

CSC has two forms of external affiliation: Sponsors and Community Partners.

### Sponsor
CSC Sponsors support CSC and its activities financially. Sponsors may be invited to events and programs, networking opportunities, limited access to CSC data, and advertisement and exposure within CSC.

### Community Partner
CSC Community Partners are reciprocal relationships with organizations based in the Greater Pittsburgh Area. CSC recognizes Community Partners for continued aid in organizing co-hosted programs, encouraging interactions between organization members, and developing a strong community within CSC, the University, and the City of Pittsburgh.

## XXVI) By-Laws

CSC officers must be present at the majority of CSC meetings and participate in at least one event (e.g., Zero to Offer, CSC Hacks, or SteelHacks).

The President, Vice President, and Business Manager may choose to swap their roles at any time. Such changes must be reported to SORC.

## XXVII) Amendments

Amendments to this Constitution may be submitted by any active club member. For approval, an amendment must receive a two-thirds majority vote of approval from the board. Amendments must be voted on at the next upcoming meeting from when they are submitted, but their implementation, if successful, may be deferred to the next semester or academic year. Amendments cannot be passed when there is a vacancy.

All constitution additions, revisions, and deletions must be reported to SORC.
